                    <h1>Culture of Asia</h1>
                    <p>Asia hosts a number of strong cultures. The strongest among them are the East Asian culture, the
                        Indian culture, and the Moslem culture.
                        he East Asian culture, often also called the Confucian culture, prevails in communities that use
                        chopsticks: the Chinese communities (the Chinese Mainland, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macao), Japan,
                        the two Koreas, Vietnam, and a large part of Singapore.
                        The strongest among them are the East Asian culture, the Indian culture, and the Moslem culture.
                        They are cultures in which education inherits the strong examination orientation in ancient
                        China, where formal education was the only path for upward social mobility. Societies in East
                        Asia still place high values on formal education. Among others, the East Asian education systems
                        also place serious emphasis on the social or moral aspects of students' development.

                        The Indian culture is an oversimplified umbrella term that covers different traditions derived
                        from Hinduism. The education systems in South Asia often carry a strong religious orientation,
                        and emphasize the relations between humans and nature. Because of the British colonial past,
                        many of the South Asian systems of education also bear a strong framework borrowed from the
                        traditional British system.

                    <h1>Culture of Europe</h1>
                    <p>Europe's cultural heritage is a rich and diverse mosaic of cultural and
                        creative expressions, an inheritance from previous generations of Europeans and a legacy for
                        those to come. It includes natural, built and archaeological sites, museums, monuments,
                        artworks, historic cities, literary, musical and audiovisual works, and the knowledge, practices
                        and traditions of European citizens. Cultural heritage enriches the individual lives of
                        citizens, is a driving force for the cultural and creative sectors, and plays a role in creating
                        and enhancing Europe's social capital. It is also an important resource for economic growth,
                        employment and social cohesion, offering the potential to revitalise urban and rural areas and
                        promote sustainable tourism. While policy in this area is primarily the responsibility of Member
                        States, regional and local authorities, the EU is committed to safeguarding and enhancing
                        Europe's cultural heritage through a number of policies and programmes.Europe has some wierd but
                        amazing festivles
                        (1)The Tomatina Festival- Spain:
                        Do you like eating? How about vegetables? Or do you prefer throwing food at other people? If
                        that is the case, you should go to Buñol, Spain and enjoy the biggest tomato fight in the world.
                        The event is held on the last Wednesday of August so it can be the final stop of your summer
                        trip.
                        (2)Wife-carrying Championship: Finland
                        Are you already fed up with running alone? You can try one of the favourite Finnish sports,
                        “wife carrying”. Men basically carry their female partner and race. There are strict rules and
                        different ways how a man can carry their companion.
                        (3)Let's move on to one of the favourite times of the year - Christmas. You can find many
                        traditions across Europe which take place around this time. There is one unknown custom
                        especially worth to mention. In the beginning of December in homes in Catalonia, Spain, you can
                        find an item called Caga Tió, which consists of a wooden log with a face painted on one end.
                        children are given a stick to hit Caga Tió. They can also sing a special song. Afterwards, they
                        find small toys and sweets that have fallen out of the log

                    and enhancing Europe's social capital. It is also an important resource for economic growth,
                    employment and social cohesion, offering the potential to revitalise urban and rural areas and
                    promote sustainable tourism. While policy in this area is primarily the responsibility of Member

                    Europe's cultural heritage through a number of policies and programmes.Europe has some wierd but
                    amazing festivles
                    (1)The Tomatina Festival- Spain:
                    Do you like eating? How about vegetables? Or do you prefer throwing food at other people? If
                    that is the case, you should go to Buñol, Spain and enjoy the biggest tomato fight in the world.
                    The event is held on the last Wednesday of August so it can be the final stop of your summer
                    trip.
                    (2)Wife-carrying Championship: Finland
                    Are you already fed up with running alone? You can try one of the favourite Finnish sports,
                    “wife carrying”. Men basically carry their female partner and race. There are strict rules and
                    different ways how a man can carry their companion.
                    (3)Let's move on to one of the favourite times of the year - Christmas. You can find many
                    traditions across Europe which take place around this time. There is one unknown custom
                    especially worth to mention. In the beginning of December in homes in Catalonia, Spain, you can
                    find an item called Caga Tió, which consists of a wooden log with a face painted on one end.
                    children are given a stick to hit Caga Tió. They can also sing a special song. Afterwards, they
                    find small toys and sweets that have fallen out of the log

    <p class="explore-asia-text">Asia, the world's largest and most diverse continent. It occupies the eastern
        four-fifths of the giant Eurasian landmass. Asia is more a geographic term than a homogeneous continent, and
        the use of the term to describe such a vast area always carries the potential of obscuring the enormous
        diversity among the regions it encompasses. !</p>

                <h1>Culture of Europe</h1>
                <p>Europe's cultural heritage is a rich and diverse mosaic of cultural and
                    creative expressions, an inheritance from previous generations of Europeans and a legacy for
                    those to come. It includes natural, built and archaeological sites, museums, monuments,
                    artworks, historic cities, literary, musical and audiovisual works, and the knowledge, practices
                    and traditions of European citizens. Cultural heritage enriches the individual lives of
                    citizens, is a driving force for the cultural and creative sectors, and plays a role in creating
                    and enhancing Europe's social capital. It is also an important resource for economic growth,
                    employment and social cohesion, offering the potential to revitalise urban and rural areas and
                    promote sustainable tourism. While policy in this area is primarily the responsibility of Member
                    States, regional and local authorities, the EU is committed to safeguarding and enhancing
                    Europe's cultural heritage through a number of policies and programmes.Europe has some wierd but
                    amazing festivles
                    (1)The Tomatina Festival- Spain:
                    Do you like eating? How about vegetables? Or do you prefer throwing food at other people? If
                    that is the case, you should go to Buñol, Spain and enjoy the biggest tomato fight in the world.
                    The event is held on the last Wednesday of August so it can be the final stop of your summer
                    trip.
                    (2)Wife-carrying Championship: Finland
                    Are you already fed up with running alone? You can try one of the favourite Finnish sports,
                    “wife carrying”. Men basically carry their female partner and race. There are strict rules and
                    different ways how a man can carry their companion.
                    (3)Let's move on to one of the favourite times of the year - Christmas. You can find many
                    traditions across Europe which take place around this time. There is one unknown custom
                    especially worth to mention. In the beginning of December in homes in Catalonia, Spain, you can
                    find an item called Caga Tió, which consists of a wooden log with a face painted on one end.
                    children are given a stick to hit Caga Tió. They can also sing a special song. Afterwards, they
                    find small toys and sweets that have fallen out of the log
