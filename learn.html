                    <h1>Culture</h1>
                    <p>Asia hosts a number of strong cultures. The strongest among them are the East Asian culture, the Indian culture, and the Moslem culture. he East Asian culture, often also called the Confucian culture, prevails in communities that use
                        chopsticks: the Chinese communities (the Chinese Mainland, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macao), Japan, the two Koreas, Vietnam, and a large part of Singapore. The strongest among them are the East Asian culture, the Indian culture, and
                        the Moslem culture. They are cultures in which education inherits the strong examination orientation in ancient China, where formal education was the only path for upward social mobility. Societies in East Asia still place high
                        values on formal education. Among others, the East Asian education systems also place serious emphasis on the social or moral aspects of students' development. The Indian culture is an oversimplified umbrella term that covers different
                        traditions derived from Hinduism. The education systems in South Asia often carry a strong religious orientation, and emphasize the relations between humans and nature. Because of the British colonial past, many of the South Asian
                        systems of education also bear a strong framework borrowed from the traditional British system.

                    <h1>Vegation & Wildlife</h1>
                    <p>Asia's natural vegetation greatly varies as per the diverse landform and climate conditions. Pine trees grow in very cold conditions of the month. Their leaves are rolled up to form needles and this prevents them from losing water.
                        These conical-shaped coniferous forests are found extensively in Siberian plain. The pine forest belt is known as taiga. There is a region of grassland called steppe in a band extending across China, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Russia,
                        and extending further into Europe. Temperate forests have broad-leaved trees.Tropical rain forest found in the areas near the equator is very thick with tall trees up to 30 m, some are much higher and than other lower-level trees.
                        There are many species, of animals, birds and insects. The wood is hard and valuable. Many of the Asian forests are in danger from deforestation and there is very little vegetation in the hot deserts of the Arabian Peninsula. Because
                        Asia is a continent and not a country, there is no official animal. However, there is wildlife that one might recognize as being representative of Asia in popular culture: The Giant Panda of China is a global icon and China's national
                        treasure that has been brought back from being “endangered” and is now listed as “vulnerable,” thanks to strong conservation efforts in the country. It is native to the bamboo forests of South Central China. This true bear shares
                        a common ancestor with the family Ursidae but diverged about 1.9 million years ago, making this species a living fossil. The Asian Elephant is the biggest of the continent's land-dwelling mammals, although it's smaller than its
                        African relative. The 3 subspecies are the Indian, Sumatran, and Sri Lankan. Its weight can reach 11,000lbs, its length can reach 21ft (6.4m) and height can reach 11.5ft (3.5m). This species is listed as Endangered. The Asian Black
                        Bear is a medium-sized bear that lives in forests all across the continent. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. The tiger is another common global icon for Asia. There are 6 surviving tiger subspecies on the continent:
                        (1) Amur (Siberian) (2) Indian (Bengal) (3) South China (4) Malayan (5) Indochinese (6) Sumatran

                    <p>Europe is a continent which is also recognised as part of Eurasia, located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west,
                        the Mediterranean Sea to the south and Asia to the east. Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed of the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian Sea, the Greater Caucasus, the Black Sea and the
                        waterways of the Turkish Straits.Although much of this border is over land, Europe covers about 10.18 million km2 (3.93 million sq mi), or 2% of the Earth's surface (6.8% of land area), making it the second-smallest continent (using
                        the seven-continent model). Europe had a total population of about 746 million (about 10% of the world population) in 2018 Europe can be divided into four major physical regions, running from north to south: Western Uplands, North
                        European Plain, Central Uplands, and Alpine Mountains. The Western Uplands, also known as the Northern Highlands, curve up the western edge of Europe and define the physical landscape of Scandinavia, Finland, Iceland, Scotland,
                        Ireland, The North European Plain extends from the southern United Kingdom east to Russia. It includes parts of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Poland, the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania), and
                        Belarus. Most of the Great European Plain lies below 152 meters (500 feet) in elevation. It is home to many navigable rivers, including the Rhine, Weser, Elbe, Oder, and Vistula. The Central Uplands extend east-west across central
                        Europe and include western France and Belgium, southern Germany, the Czech Republic, and parts of northern Switzerland and Austria. The Central Uplands are lower in altitude and less rugged than the Alpine region and are heavily
                        wooded. </p>

                    <h1>Culture</h1>
                    <p>Europe's cultural heritage is a rich and diverse mosaic of cultural and creative expressions, an inheritance from previous generations of Europeans and a legacy for those to come. It includes natural, built and archaeological sites,
                        museums, monuments, artworks, historic cities, literary, musical and audiovisual works, and the knowledge, practices and traditions of European citizens. Cultural heritage enriches the individual lives of citizens, is a driving
                        force for the cultural and creative sectors, and plays a role in creating and enhancing Europe's social capital. It is also an important resource for economic growth, employment and social cohesion, offering the potential to revitalise
                        urban and rural areas and promote sustainable tourism. While policy in this area is primarily the responsibility of Member States, regional and local authorities, the EU is committed to safeguarding and enhancing Europe's cultural
                        heritage through a number of policies and programmes.Europe has some wierd but amazing festivles (1)The Tomatina Festival- Spain: Do you like eating? How about vegetables? Or do you prefer throwing food at other people? If that
                        is the case, you should go to Buñol, Spain and enjoy the biggest tomato fight in the world. The event is held on the last Wednesday of August so it can be the final stop of your summer trip. (2)Wife-carrying Championship: Finland
                        Are you already fed up with running alone? You can try one of the favourite Finnish sports, “wife carrying”. Men basically carry their female partner and race. There are strict rules and different ways how a man can carry their
                        companion. (3)Let's move on to one of the favourite times of the year - Christmas. You can find many traditions across Europe which take place around this time. There is one unknown custom especially worth to mention. In the beginning
                        of December in homes in Catalonia, Spain, you can find an item called Caga Tió, which consists of a wooden log with a face painted on one end. children are given a stick to hit Caga Tió. They can also sing a special song. Afterwards,
                        they find small toys and sweets that have fallen out of the log

                    <h1>Vegation & Wildlife</h1>
                    <p>Much like its physical regions, Europes plant and animal communities follow a general north-south orientation. The tundra, found in Iceland and the northern reaches of Scandinavia and Russia, is a treeless region where small mosses,
                        lichens, and ferns grow. Huge herds of reindeer feed on these tiny plants. The taiga, which stretches across northern Europe just south of the tundra, is composed of coniferous forests, with trees such as pine, spruce, and fir.
                        Moose, bear, and elk are native to the European taiga. Just south of the taiga is a mixture of coniferous and deciduous trees, including beech, ash, poplar, and willow. Although this area remains heavily forested, the continents
                        forests were drastically reduced as a result of intense urbanization throughout human history. Intense trade introduced many species, which often overtook native plants. Finally, small, drought-resistant plants border the Mediterranean
                        Sea, Europes southern edge. Trees also grow in that southernmost region, including the Aleppo pine, cypress, and cork oak. The European bison, the heaviest land animal on the continent, is one of the most threatened species. While
                        many animals have been introduced into Europe from other parts of the world, several species are native to the continent. European bison, Euroasian lynx, polar bears and other bears, moose, and wolves are all mammal species native
                        to Europe. The Capercaillie, European Bee-eater, and the Golden Eagle are all bird species originally found on the continent, as well. Wildlife in Europe, like the rest of the world, is facing threats of endangerment from human
                        encroachment and poaching. Protective as measures continue to be implemented in order to preserve these nails and their natural environments. Europe is surrounded on three sides by water: the Atlantic Ocean, the Artic Ocean, and
                        the Mediterranean Sea. Within these waters are multitudes of marine species, ranging from porpoises to fish to bivalves. As for fishing, some of the most unique and beautiful places to fish, most commonly caught fish being: Carp
                        Salmon Trout Bluefin Tuna Seabream Halibut Cod

                    <h1>Location & physical features</h1>
                    <p>Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most populous continent, after Asia in both cases. At about 30.3 million km2 (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20%
                        of its land area. With 1.3 billion people as of 2018, it accounts for about 16% of the world's human population. Africa's population is the youngest amongst all the continents, the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide
                        median age was 30.4. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes
                        Madagascar and various archipelagos. Africa has eight major physical regions: the Sahara, the Sahel, the Ethiopian Highlands, the savanna, the Swahili Coast, the rain forest, the African Great Lakes, and Southern Africa. The Sahara
                        is the worlds largest hot desert, covering 8.5 million square kilometers (3.3 million square miles), about the size of the South American country of Brazil. The Sahel is a narrow band of semi-arid land that forms a transition zone
                        between the Sahara to the north and the savannas to the south. The Ethiopian Highlands began to rise 75 million years ago, as magma from Earths mantle uplifted a broad dome of ancient rock. Savannas, or grasslands, cover almost
                        half of Africa, more than 13 million square kilometers (5 million square miles). These grasslands make up most of central Africa, beginning south of the Sahara and the Sahel and ending north of the continents southern tip. The
                        Swahili Coast stretches about 1,610 kilometers (1,000 miles) along the Indian Ocean, from Somalia to Mozambique. The nearby coral reefs and barrier islands protect the coast from severe weather. 80 percent of Africas rain forest
                        is concentrated in central Africa, along the Congo River basin.The Great Lakes are located in nine countries that surround the Great Rift Valley. The region of Southern Africa is dominated by the Kaapvaal craton, a shelf of bedrock
                        that is more than 2.6 billion years old</p>

                    <h1>Culture</h1>
                    <p>The culture of Africa is incredibly interesting due to the fact it is varied, depending on which country you visit. The continent is home to diverse populations, many of which have been influenced by external factors. Each country
                        has its own tribes, languages and cultural differences. Even small African countries like Uganda have more than thirty established tribes. We will now take a look at some of the most well-established products of African culture
                        including tribes, food, arts and language The Zulu people are South Africa's largest ethnic group. It is estimated that between ten and eleven million people live in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. During 19th and 20th much of South
                        Africa was under apartheid and the Zulu people were classed as third-class citizens often suffering from discrimination. Today they have equal rights along with all other citizens. The Maasai people live in the Rift Valley region
                        of Kenya and Tanzania. They own large herds of cattle, sheep and goats, which they regularly move around to new grazing grounds and water sources. They are a proud and independent tribe who base their wealth and power on cattle.
                        The more cattle a Maasai member has, the more rich and powerful they are seen as by their tribe. There are more than fifty unique tribes living in the Omo River Region of South western Ethiopia, making it a great place to visit
                        if you are interesting in African culture. Many of the traditional customs and beliefs have remained intact due to lack of access to area. African Food- Many people living in Eastern, Western and Southern African villages are farmers.
                        They live almost entirely off the food they grow themselves. Traditional African food is also sold at outdoor markets. In countries like Morocco and Algeria couscous is a popular dish served with meat and vegetables. In Western
                        Africa it is common for people to grow and eat cassava, maize, mille and plantains. When visiting African countries you will find that they are very traditional, with most woman and girls carrying out the task of cooking meals.
                        Colonisation has also affected the food and drink served in some parts of Africa such as Kenya where it is common for people to drink tea. African Art- Africans are one of the biggest contributors to sculptural art. The art form
                        of African sculpture dates back thousands of years with some of the earliest sculptures being found in Egypt. There are thousands of indigenous languages and dialects spoken in Africa. Every African country has its own languages,
                        even the smaller countries.

                    <p>The top wild animals in Africa are those that people most often seek out in safaris, with many being animals native to Africa. These safari animals are housed in national parks, game reserves, and other sanctuaries for both human safety
                        as well as to avoid their becoming part of the extinct animals in Africa. Among the best-known African animals are the “Big Five” which are the Lion, Leopard, Elephant, Rhinoceros, and Buffalo. All of them can be seen in South
                        Africa and are native animals: some of the most deadlist animal of continent Mosquito: Causes diseases including Malaria, Yellow Fever, Zeka Virus, West Nile Virus, and Dengue Fever; 1,000,000 deaths. Hippopotamus: Territorial
                        and weighs up to 1,500kg, making it the third-largest animal after the elephant and rhino; 3,000 deaths. African Elephant: Largest land animal; weighs up to 7,000kg and is unpredictable; tramples victims; 500 deaths. Nile Crocodile:
                        Aggressive, fatal attacks; 300 deaths. Lion: Apex predator; kills locals during their daily lives or on the fringes of game reserves; 200 deaths. Cape Buffalo: Nicknamed “widowmaker” and “black death”; fearless, aggressive, and
                        unpredictable; will stalk and kill humans if alone; tramples and gores victims to death; weighs up to 1,000kg; 200 deaths. Great White Shark: Most aggressive shark towards humans; charges at prey up to 40km an hour before taking
                        a large bite; humans die from blood loss in 20 percent of cases; 2 deaths. Rhinoceros: Weighs up to 2,800kg and second largest animal after the elephant; irritable, and charges with long, sharp horns up to 64km an hour when threatened;
                        unknown. Puff Adder: Not the most venomous snake but causes the most fatalities due to its wide habitat range, camoflauge colors and aggressiveness; 20 percent fatality rate from untreated bites. Black Mamba: Largest venomous snake
                        in Africa, growing up to 2.5m; one of the world's fastest snakes, moving at 20km an hour; highly aggressive; one of the most venomous snakes in the world with a 100% fatality for untreated bites. African vegetation develops in
                        direct response to the interacting effects of rainfall, temperature, topography, and type of soil; it is further modified by the incidence of fire, human agriculture, and grazing and browsing by livestock. Of the total land area
                        of the continent, forests cover about one-fifth; woodlands, bushlands, grasslands, and thickets about two-fifths; and deserts and their extended margins the remaining two-fifths.</p>

                    <h1>Location & physical features</h1>
                    <p>North America is a continent in the Northern Hemisphere and almost entirely within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be described as the northern subcontinent of a single continent, America. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic
                        Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea, and to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean. Because it is on the North American Tectonic Plate, Greenland is included as part
                        of North America geographically. North America covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers (9,540,000 square miles), about 16.5% of the Earth's land area and about 4.8% of its total surface. North America is the third-largest
                        continent by area, following Asia and Africa, and the fourth by population after Asia, Africa, and Europe. In 2013, its population was estimated at nearly 579 million people in 23 independent states, or about 7.5% of the world's
                        population. North America can be divided into five physical regions: the mountainous west, the Great Plains, the Canadian Shield, the varied eastern region, and the Caribbean. Mexico and Central America's western coast are connected
                        to the mountainous west, while its lowlands and coastal plains extend into the eastern region.Western Region Young mountains rise in the west. The most familiar of these mountains are probably the Rockies, North America's largest
                        chain. The Rockies stretch from the province of British Columbia, Canada, to the U.S. state of New Mexico.The Great Plains lie in the middle of the continent. Deep, rich soil blankets large areas of the plains in Canada and the
                        United States. Grain grown in this region, called the “Breadbasket of North America,” feeds a large part of the world.Eastern Region This varied region includes the Appalachian Mountains and the Atlantic coastal plain. North America's
                        older mountain ranges, including the Appalachians, rise near the east coast of the United States and CanadaCaribbean Region The Caribbean Region includes more than 7,000 islands, islets, reefs, and cays. The region's islands and
                        smaller islets are varied in their topography; some have relatively flat and sandy terrain while others are rugged, mountainous, and volcanic.</p>

                    <p>the United States is one of the most culturally diverse countries in the world, according to The London School. Nearly every region of the world has influenced American culture, most notably the English who colonized the country beginning
                        in the early 1600s, according to the Library of Congress. U.S. culture has also been shaped by the cultures of Indigenous Americans, Latin Americans, Africans and Asians.There is no official language of the United States, according
                        to the U.S. government. While almost every language in the world is spoken in the United States, the most frequently spoken non-English languages are Spanish, Chinese, French and German. Ninety percent of the U.S. population speaks
                        and understands at least some English, and most official business is conducted in English.The Census Bureau estimates that more than 350 languages are spoken in the United States.Nearly every known religion is practiced in the
                        United States, which was founded on the basis of religious freedom. About 70% of Americans identify themselves as Christians, according to information gathered by the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan research group, in 2017.
                        The research also found that about 23% had no religious affiliation at all and around 6% of the population is made up non-Christian religions. Clothing styles vary by social status, region, occupation and climate. Jeans, sneakers,
                        baseball caps, cowboy hats and boots are some items of clothing that are closely associated with Americans, though there have been a variety of other styles throughout the decades, according to InterExchange. Ralph Lauren, Calvin
                        Klein, Michael Kors and Victoria Secret are some well-known American brands. American fashion is widely influenced by celebrities and the media, in 2019 US Clothing and Accessories sales amounted to 24 Billion US Dollars, according
                        to Statista. American cuisine was influenced by Europeans and Native Americans in its early history. Today, there are a number of foods that are commonly identified as American, such as hamburgers, hot dogs, potato chips, macaroni
                        and cheese, and meat loaf. "As American as apple pie", despite the dishes non-American origins, The United States is widely known around the world as a leader in mass media production, including television and movies. According
                        to the Select USA, the United States comprises one-third of the worldwide media and entertainment industry and is worth $717 Billion.

                        more than 300 amphibians and 4,000 known arachnids (e.g bark scorpions). North America includes the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Greenland, each laden with diverse ecological systems that sustain these unique animal species.A
                        mature Arizona bark scorpion is about 3 inches long (7.6 centimetres). Its coat is light brown or yellowish brown in color, enabling it to blend well in the desert. Arizona bark scorpions have two fore-claws and one rear claw,
                        and a compact body with four pairs of legs.The jaguar is the largest cat in the Americas, and third largest cat in the world after lions and tigers. Its fur is yellow and tan, but may vary from reddish brown to black. Jaguar spots

                    <h1>Location & physical features</h1>
                    <p>South America is a continent entirely in the Western Hemisphere and mostly in the Southern Hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the Northern Hemisphere. It can also be described as the southern subregion of a single continent
                        called America (see the United Nations geoscheme for the Americas). The reference to South America instead of other cultural or geographical regions South America is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the north and
                        east by the Atlantic Ocean; North America and the Caribbean Sea lie to the northwest. The continent generally includes twelve sovereign states: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname,
                        Uruguay, and Venezuela; two dependent territories: the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and one internal territory: French Guiana. Mountains and coastal plains generally run in a north-south direction,
                        while highlands and river basins generally run in an east-west direction. South America's primary mountain system, the Andes, is also the world's longest. The range covers about 8,850 kilometers (5,500 miles). Situated on the far
                        western edge of the continent, the Andes stretch from the southern tip to the northernmost coast of South America. There are hundreds of peaks more than 4,500 meters (15,000 feet) tall, many of which are volcanic. The highest peak
                        in the Andes, Aconcagua, stands at 6,962 meters (22,841 feet) and straddles the Argentina-Chile border. High plateaus are also a feature of the Andes. The altiplano of Peru and Bolivia, for example, has an elevation of about 3,700
                        meters (12,300 feet). The Patagonia region of Argentina and Chile consists of lower-elevation plateaus and rugged glaciers.River Basins South America has three important river basins: the Amazon, Orinoco, and Paraguay/Paraná. The
                        Amazon River basin has an area of almost 7 million square kilometers (2.7 million square miles), making it the largest watershed in the world. The basin, which covers most of northern South America, is fed by tributaries from the
                        glaciers of the Andes. Every second, the Amazon River empties 209,000 cubic meters (7,381,000 cubic feet) of freshwater into the Atlantic Ocean.Coastal Plains A coastal plain is an area of low, flat land next to a seacoast. South
                        American coastal plains are found on the northeastern coast of Brazil, on the Atlantic Ocean, and the western, Pacific coast of Peru and Chile. The coastal plains of northeastern Brazil are extremely dry. The Brazilian Highlands
                        act as a wedge that pushes moist sea winds away from the coastal plains.</p>

                    <h1>Culture</h1>
                    <p>The rapid expansion of communications technology has brought the social, economic, and political happenings of urban life to formerly isolated rural communities and in the process has created a transnational South American culture.
                        Songs and dances spread rapidly through continental coverage of popular shows and through the celebration of annual pop music festivals in different parts of Latin America. Some rhythms thrive in particular regions: salsa is popular
                        in the countries bordering the Caribbean Sea; samba is exclusive to coastal Brazil; in the Andean countries ballads accompanied by guitar are preferred; while in the southern cone romantic songs with Spanish roots are dominant.
                        Passion for football (soccer) is both a unifying and a dividing force in the continent. Seemingly endless competitions are followed with fervour, the most popular being the qualification matches for the world championships (held
                        every four years) and the elimination games for the continental championship (Copa Libertadores de America; held every year). Boxing is also a popular spectator sport. Bullfights and cockfights, once very popular in Peru and Colombia,
                        respectively, have lost appeal in the last decades. Horse racing, and the associated betting, is still a favourite in Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Venezuela, and Chile.Strongly derived from the general Latino attitudes and values
                        are the televised soap operas (telenovelas). Those produced in Mexico are the most dominant, while Argentine series cater chiefly to southern cone viewers. The typical story lines portray heroines who are ready to defend their
                        virtues against impulsive lovers. Variety shows are more popular than game shows or public interest shows on television. Although they are more country-specific because of national character traits, there has been some internationalization
                        in a few of them, particularly when broadcast out of Miami. Movies made in Hollywood dominate everywhere. While in some rural cinemas Mexican country dramas are still popular, in the major cities of the continent, European and
                        American movies are shown.

                        Tropical rainforests are found in the equatorial regions in South America.The largest forest is the Amazon rain forests forest, which covers more than two million square miles of South America. Much of this rain forest is located
                        in Brazil.Grasslands are found in the regions which receive rainfall during summer season like in Guyana and Brazil. Scrub vegetation is found in the regions which hardly receive any rainfall. Parts of northern Mexico are classified

                        important economic and cultural centres of Sydney and Melbourne.The Australian mainland extends from west to east for nearly 2,500 miles (4,000 km) and from Cape York Peninsula in the northeast to Wilsons Promontory in the southeast
                        for nearly 2,000 miles (3,200 km). To the south, Australian jurisdiction extends a further 310 miles (500 km) to the southern extremity of the island of Tasmania, and in the north it extends to the southern shores of Papua New
                        Guinea. Australia is separated from Indonesia to the northwest by the Timor and Arafura seas, from Papua New Guinea to the northeast by the Coral Sea and the Torres Strait, from the Coral Sea Islands Territory by the Great Barrier
                        Reef, from New Zealand to the southeast by the Tasman Sea, and from Antarctica in the far south by the Indian Ocean. Australia can be divided into three physical regions. The Eastern Highland reason of Australia is the highest
                        part of Australia being series of hills, Mountains and plateaus.The highland stretch for 3000km parallel to south the distinct height of the highland is 900 m from sea level.The eastern highland is known as the great dividing ranges,
                        further subdivided into a small range. ranges includeNew England plateaus, the Australia Alpes, the snowyMountains and the Grampian mountains. The central lowlands extend from gulf of carpenteria in the north to the encounter bay

                        Eastern Highland reason of Australia is the highest part of Australia being series of hills, Mountains and plateaus.The highland stretch for 3000km parallel to south the distinct height of the highland is 900 m from sea level.The
                        central lowlands extend from gulf of carpenteria in the north to the encounter bay in the south.the central lowland are very dry because of rainfall blocked by the eastern highlands.

                    <h1>Culture of Europe</h1>
                    <p>Although Australia is a predominantly Christian country with about 52% of all Australians identifying as Christian, there is no official state religion. People in Australia are free to practice any religion they choose, as long as
                        they are not breaking the law. Religions from all over the world are practiced in Australia, demonstrating its cultural diversity. Most universities and communities in Australia have facilities and places of worship for all types
                        of faith, so international students in Australia should contact their international student officer about facilities at their educational institution.Australia has no official language, but the majority of the population speaks
                        English as a first language. According to the 2016 census, 73% of people in Australia spoke only English at home, even including a large number of first- and second-generation migrants. Australian English has a distinctive accent
                        and vocabulary. Because people from about 200 countries around the world have migrated to Australia, there is a vast collection of languages spoken in the country.Australian art dates back to prehistoric times. It includes Aboriginal,
                        Colonial, Landscape, Atelier, early twentieth century painters, printmakers, photographers, sculptors, and contemporary art. Art in Australia has a long history. There is evidence of Aboriginal art that dates back at least 30,000
                        years. Examples of Aboriginal rock artwork can be found throughout the continent. Australia has produced many notable artists of both Western and Indigenous Australian schools throughout the course of its long and impressive history.Australia
                        has many major art museums and galleries, both supported by the national, state, and local government, and by university and privately owned museums. The more prominent of these museums include the National Gallery of Australia,
                        the National Portrait Gallery of Australia, the National Museum of Australia, the Canberra Museum and Gallery, the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, and the Art Gallery of New South Wales. In addition, there are the Museum
                        of Contemporary Art in Sydney, the Queensland Art Gallery in Brisbane, the South Australian Art Gallery in Adelaide, the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery in Hobart, the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory in Darwin,
                        and the Art Gallery of Western Australia in Perth.

                    <h1>Vegetation & wildlife</h1>
                    <p>We can found various types of vegetation in Australia. Some kinds of natural vegetation of Australia are given below: tropical Vegetation:We can found this types of vegetation in Northeastern coast and the coast of Queensland. We can
                        found here trees like bamboo, birch, palm and cedar etc. Tropical Grasslands/Savanna:Savanna grasslands are the largest grassland of the world. It is found in the Murray-Darling basin of the Australia. Because of huge pasture land,
                        people engage in animal husbandry and cattle rearing. Mediterranean Vegetation:This types of vegetation are mostly found in the southern part of the Australia. We can found trees like Eucalyptus, rubber, karri, jarrah etc. Desert
                        Vegetation: This is the dry vegetation found in the western plateau. Plants are found having the throne in it, like acacia, salt-bush, mallee, cactus etc. Temperate Grasslands:Temperate grasslands are found in the southern belt
                        of the tropical vegetation. It receives less rainfall so it has scanty shrubs and short trees. The grassland found in Australia are called Downs. Australia's most famous animals are its marsupials. Koalas, kangaroos, and wombats
                        are some of the world's best-loved animals. Australia is also famous for its large, scary alligators and its many deadly snake species. Australia has some unusual members of the monotreme family, including the platypus and echidna.
                        In fact, when biologists first saw a platypus, some of them thought it was a crazy, elaborate hoax and not a real animal. There are large numbers of animals that were introduced as domestic pets but are now wild. These include
                        dingoes, water buffalos, camels, donkeys, pigs, goats, and betangs, which are cows that originated in Asia. Australia's national animal is the red kangaroo (Macropus rufus). Also known as the red giant kangaroo, it is the biggest
                        land mammal that's native to Australia.Koalas are an important cultural symbol to Australians.Emu: The second largest bird in the world. Emus are found in a variety of habitats throughout most of Australia. Rock Parrot: Endemic
                        to coastal habitats of Southern Australia. These mostly terrestrial parrots can be seen foraging in pairs and small flocks in the early morning and late afternoons. Little Penguin: The smallest species of penguin. They nest on
                        Austalia's southern coastline. Phillip Island has the largest colony of little penguins in Australia. Laughing Kookaburra: Known for their laughing call. They are native to eastern Australia. Cassowary: The heaviest bird in Australia.
                        Cassowaries are flightless birds closely related to emus. They are found in tropical habitats of North Queensland, Australia. You can see them in Daintree rainforest. Tawny Frogmouth: Often mistaken for owls, these birds are related
                        to nightjars. They are found in a variety of habitats throughout the mainland. These nocturnal birds camouflage with branches during the day.

                    <h1>Location & physical features</h1>
                    <p>Antarctica is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern
                        Ocean. At 14,200,000 square kilometres (5,500,000 square miles), it is the fifth-largest continent and nearly twice the size of Australia. It is by far the least populated continent, with around 5,000 people in the summer and around
                        1,000 in the winter. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages 1.9 km (1.2 mi; 6,200 ft) in thickness.Antarctica's dome-shaped ice sheet has been formed by snow. The snow has accumulated over hundreds of thousands
                        of years and compressed into ice. The ice generally flows from the centre of the continent towards the surrounding ocean. There are thousands of glaciers extending into the sea. Great pieces of ice break away at the coast and drift
                        away as icebergs. Except for coastal peaks, only the highest Antarctic mountains show above the icecap. The Prince Charles Mountains inland of Mawson and the Transantarctic Mountains in the Eastern Sector, contain the highest peaks
                        in Australian Antarctic Territory. During winter, it gets so cold that the sea surrounding Antarctica freezes for hundreds of kilometres offshore. The ice breaks up to form pack-ice. Under the action of winds and currents, pack-ice
                        is constantly changing its form and distribution. Antarctica is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. The Southern Ocean connects the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. The Antarctic circumpolar current circles from west to east
                        around Antarctica. It is the largest current in the world.</p>

                    <h1>scientific research</h1>
                    <p>Regarded as the “international continent”, Antarctica is a place of worldwide cooperation, peace, and scientific discovery. There are currently 70 permanent research stations scattered across the continent of Antarctica, which represent
                        29 countries from every continent on Earth. Together, these countries, or 'signatories' of the Antarctic Treaty, must ensure the preservation and wellbeing of the natural land, and to cooperate with their fellow explorers. Each
                        signatory of the treaty maintains either year round or seasonal stations throughout Antarctica. Some countries even maintain both, in order to maximize the amount of seasonal research that can be conducted. The history behind the
                        establishment of these stations hasn't always been glamorous. Not only is it difficult to travel to Antarctica in the first place, but there's an immense amount of work that goes into building and maintaining these stations, some
                        of which hold up to 1,200 people at peak summer hours. Still, the human spirit persists, and has resulted in the construction of some of the most amazing and interesting places on Earth. The Antarctic Treaty and related agreements,
                        collectively known as the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS), regulate international relations with respect to Antarctica, Earth's only continent without a native human population. It was the first arms control agreement established
                        during the Cold War, setting aside the continent as a scientific preserve, establishing freedom of scientific investigation, and banning military activity; for the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined as all the
                        land and ice shelves south of 60°S latitude. Since September 2004, the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat, which implements the treaty system, is headquartered in Buenos Aires, Argentina.International ownership treaties Antarctic Treaty
                        SystemLaw of the SeaOuter Space TreatyMoon TreatyInternational waters vte The main treaty was opened for signature on December 1, 1959, and officially entered into force on June 23, 1961. The original signatories were the 12 countries
                        active in Antarctica during the International Geophysical Year (IGY) of 1957-58: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Chile, France, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States.These
                        countries had established over 55 Antarctic research stations for the IGY, and the subsequent promulgation of the treaty was seen as a diplomatic expression of the operational and scientific cooperation that had been achieved.
                        As of 2019, the treaty has 54 parties.
