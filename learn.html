                    <h1>Culture of Asia</h1>
                    <p>Asia hosts a number of strong cultures. The strongest among them are the East Asian culture, the
                        Indian culture, and the Moslem culture.
                        he East Asian culture, often also called the Confucian culture, prevails in communities that use
                        chopsticks: the Chinese communities (the Chinese Mainland, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macao), Japan,
                        the two Koreas, Vietnam, and a large part of Singapore.
                        The strongest among them are the East Asian culture, the Indian culture, and the Moslem culture.
                        They are cultures in which education inherits the strong examination orientation in ancient
                        China, where formal education was the only path for upward social mobility. Societies in East
                        Asia still place high values on formal education. Among others, the East Asian education systems
                        also place serious emphasis on the social or moral aspects of students' development.

                        The Indian culture is an oversimplified umbrella term that covers different traditions derived
                        from Hinduism. The education systems in South Asia often carry a strong religious orientation,
                        and emphasize the relations between humans and nature. Because of the British colonial past,
                        many of the South Asian systems of education also bear a strong framework borrowed from the
                        traditional British system.

                    <h1>vegation and wildlife</h1>
                    <p>Asia's natural vegetation greatly varies as per the diverse landform and climate conditions. Pine
                        trees grow in very cold conditions of the month. Their leaves are rolled up to form needles and
                        this prevents them from losing water. These conical-shaped coniferous forests are found
                        extensively in Siberian plain. The pine forest belt is known as taiga. There is a region of
                        grassland called steppe in a band extending across China, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Russia, and
                        extending further into Europe. Temperate forests have broad-leaved trees.Tropical rain forest
                        found in the areas near the equator is very thick with tall trees up to 30 m, some are much
                        higher and than other lower-level trees. There are many species, of animals, birds and insects.
                        The wood is hard and valuable. Many of the Asian forests are in danger from deforestation and
                        there is very little vegetation in the hot deserts of the Arabian Peninsula.
                        Because Asia is a continent and not a country, there is no official animal. However, there is
                        wildlife that one might recognize as being representative of Asia in popular culture:

                        The Giant Panda of China is a global icon and China's national treasure that has been brought
                        back from being “endangered” and is now listed as “vulnerable,” thanks to strong conservation
                        efforts in the country. It is native to the bamboo forests of South Central China. This true
                        bear shares a common ancestor with the family Ursidae but diverged about 1.9 million years ago,
                        making this species a living fossil.

                        The Asian Elephant is the biggest of the continent's land-dwelling mammals, although it's
                        smaller than its African relative. The 3 subspecies are the Indian, Sumatran, and Sri Lankan.
                        Its weight can reach 11,000lbs, its length can reach 21ft (6.4m) and height can reach 11.5ft
                        (3.5m). This species is listed as Endangered.

                        The Asian Black Bear is a medium-sized bear that lives in forests all across the continent. It
                        is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. The tiger is another common global icon for Asia.
                        There are 6 surviving tiger subspecies on the continent:

                       (1) Amur (Siberian)
                       (2) Indian (Bengal)
                       (3) South China

                    <p>Europe's cultural heritage is a rich and diverse mosaic of cultural and
                        creative expressions, an inheritance from previous generations of Europeans and a legacy for
                        those to come. It includes natural, built and archaeological sites, museums, monuments,
                        artworks, historic cities, literary, musical and audiovisual works, and the knowledge, practices
                        and traditions of European citizens. Cultural heritage enriches the individual lives of
                        citizens, is a driving force for the cultural and creative sectors, and plays a role in creating
                        and enhancing Europe's social capital. It is also an important resource for economic growth,
                        employment and social cohesion, offering the potential to revitalise urban and rural areas and
                        promote sustainable tourism. While policy in this area is primarily the responsibility of Member

                        (2)Wife-carrying Championship: Finland
                        Are you already fed up with running alone? You can try one of the favourite Finnish sports,
                        “wife carrying”. Men basically carry their female partner and race. There are strict rules and
                        different ways how a man can carry their companion.
                        (3)Let's move on to one of the favourite times of the year - Christmas. You can find many
                        traditions across Europe which take place around this time. There is one unknown custom
                        especially worth to mention. In the beginning of December in homes in Catalonia, Spain, you can
                        find an item called Caga Tió, which consists of a wooden log with a face painted on one end.
                        children are given a stick to hit Caga Tió. They can also sing a special song. Afterwards, they
                        find small toys and sweets that have fallen out of the log
